# Local Library Catalog
A Library website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete:
    Books, Authors, Genres, and Book Instances

All information is stored in a MongoDB database

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pug, Node and Express

Node with Express back end connected to a MongoDB database, using mongoose to communicate. Pug view templates allowed for easy templating to compile HTML.

## Optimizations
The UTC time is messing up my dates. All dates are 1 day behind what was entered in the browse. Don't know how to fix that.

A should add prettier / linting

Huroku stopped being free. Need to deploy somewhere else.
