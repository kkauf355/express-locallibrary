## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pug, Node and Express

Node with Express back end connected to a MongoDB database, using mongoose to communicate. Pug view templates allowed for easy templating to compile HTML.

## Optimizations
The UTC time is messing up my dates. All dates are 1 day behind what was entered in the browse. Don't know how to fix that.
